# The Vent Guys - Image & Diversity Brand Guidelines

## Vision: "Every Central Florida customer should see themselves in our brand."

Our goal is to build a brand that reflects the vibrant, diverse community we serve. Every image we use is an opportunity to connect with our customers on a human level. Authenticity, representation, and local context are the pillars of our visual strategy.

## 1. Diversity & Representation Priorities

Our imagery must consciously represent the demographics of Central Florida.

-   **Ethnicity/Race:** Actively feature individuals from diverse backgrounds, including Hispanic, African American, Asian American, and Caucasian communities.
-   **Age:** Showcase a wide range of ages, from young professionals and families to middle-aged homeowners and seniors.
-   **Family Types:** Represent different household structures, including singles, couples, families with children, and multi-generational families.
-   **Home Styles:** Display a variety of Central Florida home architectures, such as modern, mid-century, established neighborhood homes, and townhomes.

## 2. Authenticity Standards

**Authentic > Perfect.** We prioritize genuine moments over perfectly staged shots.

-   **DO:** Use natural lighting, capture genuine expressions, and show real, relatable moments of connection.
-   **AVOID:** Overly staged photos, artificial smiles, generic "stock photo" vibes, and images that feel disconnected from our local community.

## 3. Alt-Text Requirements

**Alt-text is for inclusion, not just SEO. Describe the PERSON and the MOMENT.**

-   **Template:** `[Ethnicity/Age Descriptor] [Role/Relationship] [Action/Moment] in [Home Style/Context] Central Florida home.`

-   **✅ GOOD Examples:**
    -   "Hispanic mother and teenage daughter review air quality report after IAQ testing in their modern kitchen."
    -   "African American homeowner smiling while a Vent Guys technician explains the duct cleaning process."
    -   "Young Asian American couple reviewing before-and-after photos of their air duct cleaning on a tablet."

-   **❌ BAD Examples:**
    -   "Technician working."
    -   "Happy customer."
    -   "Duct cleaning photo."

## 4. Image Sourcing Options

1.  **Commission Local Photographers (Preferred):**
    -   **Action:** Hire Central Florida photographers to capture real customer interactions.
    -   **Benefit:** Highest authenticity and community connection.

2.  **AI-Generated Images (Use with Caution):**
    -   **Action:** Use advanced AI tools (e.g., Midjourney) with detailed prompts for photorealism and diversity.
    -   **Prompt Example:** "Photorealistic, diverse Central Florida homeowners, authentic expressions, natural lighting, professional photography style."
    -   **Requirement:** Always disclose AI-generated images in internal notes. Use for supplementary visuals only.

3.  **Stock Photo Curation (Careful Selection):**
    -   **Action:** Use diverse libraries like Unsplash, Pexels, and Adobe Stock.
    -   **Filter For:** "Real people," "authentic moments," "diverse family." Avoid generic, overly-posed images.
