# Re-Group (Repo Artifacts)

This folder contains the repo-backed artifacts used by the Re-Group operating system and the (future) **Re-Group Command Center** dashboard.

**Conventions**
- GitHub is the source of truth.
- Decisions are considered final only when placed in `re-group/03-decisions/`.
- Sprint status lives in `re-group/04-implementation/current-sprint.md`.
- AI outputs (requirements/specs/reviews) live in `re-group/02-responses/` by role.
