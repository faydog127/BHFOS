## 1. System Diagnosis Documentation Inventory
The following files constitute the system's architectural definitions, diagnosis protocols, and feature audits:

### Core Definitions (The "Constitution")
*   `src/docs/TVG_OS_v1.0_CONSTITUTION.md` - The foundational document defining the original scope and rules.
*   `src/docs/TVG_OS_v1.0_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - The official sign-off for the v1.0 MVP.
*   `docs/TVG_OS_v1.0_CONSTITUTION.md` (Duplicate reference)

### Operational Audits & Checklists
*   `src/docs/CURRENT_FEATURES_AUDIT.md` - A living document of active features vs. deprecated ones.
*   `src/docs/LIVE_MODE_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-flight checks for deploying to production.
*   `src/docs/FINAL_CLEAN_SLATE_CHECKLIST.md` - Protocols for wiping test data before handover.
*   `src/docs/SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - High-level architectural overview.

### Diagnostic Reports
*   `AUDIT_REPORT.md` / `AUDIT_REPORT_V3.md` - Historical audit logs of code quality and security.
*   `DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md` - Recent system health checks.
*   `docs/EDGE_FUNCTIONS_AUDIT.md` - Review of serverless backend functions.

## 2. MVP Lockdown: v1.0
The MVP was formally locked down in **`src/docs/TVG_OS_v1.0_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`**.

**Included in v1.0 MVP:**
Based on the constitution and implementation reports, the MVP included:
*   **Core CRM:** Leads, Customers, and Contacts management.
*   **Basic Workflow:** Estimate -> Job -> Invoice flow (Linear happy path).
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth integration.
*   **Data Structure:** Foundational tables (`leads`, `jobs`, `estimates`).

**Locked Down On:** The existence of the `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` file signifies the freeze point for v1.0 features.

## 3. Current System State (v2.5.0+) vs. MVP
The system has evolved significantly beyond the v1.0 MVP scope.

| Feature Area | v1.0 MVP Scope | Current System State (v2.5.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Call Management** | Manual entry only | **Smart Call Console** with AI scripting, recording, and "Call Hunter" features. |
| **Marketing** | Basic email notifications | **Marketing Engine** with automated campaigns, AI copy generation, and tracking. |
| **Partners** | Simple lead source field | **Partner Portal** with dedicated dashboards for Realtors, Property Managers, and B2B. |
| **Diagnostics** | Manual SQL checks | **System Doctor Console** with automated schema drift detection and self-healing. |
| **Versioning** | Static Markdown files | **Dynamic Config** (see `src/config/version.js`) and UI-based version display. |

## 4. Code Freezing & Versioning Strategy
Currently, the project uses a **hybrid versioning strategy**:

1.  **Documentation-Driven Baselines:** Major versions (v1.0, v2.0) are defined by documentation snapshots (e.g., `TVG_OS_v1.0...` files).
2.  **Runtime Version Injection:** The application version is now centralized in `src/config/version.js` and injected into the UI components (`Settings.jsx`, `SystemDiagnostics.jsx`).
3.  **Git/Deployment:** While `package.json` remains at `0.0.0` (typical for Vite/React apps not published as libraries), the "Production" version is tracked via the `CLIENT_JOURNEY_UPDATE` tag referenced in `Settings.jsx`.

**Recommendation:**
Unified versioning has been implemented in `src/config/version.js` to resolve the discrepancy between "v5.1 Diagnostics" and "v2.5.0 App Version".
