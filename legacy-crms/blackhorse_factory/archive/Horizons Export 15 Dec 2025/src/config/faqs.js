    question: 'What is the difference between air duct cleaning and mechanical hygiene?',
    answer: 'Most "duct cleanings" remove only surface dust. Mechanical hygiene, on the other hand, follows [NADCA standards](/nadca-standards-air-quality-protection) to remove contamination at the source using HEPA-filtered negative pressure and full-system agitation. It\'s not cosmetic — it\'s true restoration of your home\'s air system.',
  },
  {

    question: 'How often should my ducts be inspected or cleaned?',
    answer: 'We recommend an annual inspection and a full cleaning every 3–5 years, depending on your home\'s humidity, pets, and dust levels. In Florida, where moisture is constant, checking once a year prevents buildup before it becomes a problem.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q3',
    question: 'Why is Florida humidity such a big factor for indoor air quality?',
    answer: 'Humidity acts like glue for dust, dander, and debris inside ducts. That sticky layer traps contaminants and supports microbial growth. Proper dehumidification and [NADCA-standard cleaning](/nadca-standards-air-quality-protection) prevent this and help your home "breathe" normally again. Learn more about [Florida humidity and your ducts](/florida-humidity-hidden-duct-contamination).',

    question: 'Do you clean mold from ducts?',
    answer: 'No — The Vent Guys never "clean" mold. If microbial growth is present, the contaminated section and connected components should be removed and replaced, not wiped or sprayed. We\'ll identify the issue, document it, and refer you to a licensed mold remediator if needed.',

    question: 'How does dryer vent cleaning improve indoor air quality?',
    answer: 'A blocked dryer vent traps heat, humidity, and lint, which can backflow into your living space. That adds moisture to the air and dust to your HVAC filters. A clean vent improves both safety and system efficiency, protecting your [air](/florida-humidity-hidden-duct-contamination) and your home. Read about [dryer vent safety](/dryer-vent-cleaning-fire-safety).',

    question: 'What\'s included in your Free Air Check?',
    answer: 'It\'s a 15-minute visual walkthrough of key HVAC components — returns, supply vents, filter housing, and duct interiors (when accessible). We identify dust, debris, and moisture signs, then provide photo documentation and next-step recommendations. No pressure — just clear information. See the [full breakdown](/free-air-check-what-we-look-for).',

    id: 'q7',
    question: 'What does NADCA certification actually mean?',
    answer: 'It means your cleaning follows ACR, The [NADCA Standard](/nadca-standards-air-quality-protection) — the national guideline for HVAC system assessment, cleaning, and restoration. All NADCA-certified companies must use HEPA filtration, containment, and verification. It\'s the gold standard for [mechanical hygiene](/mechanical-hygiene-vs-duct-cleaning).',
  },
  {
    id: 'q8',
    question: 'How does clean ductwork improve my family\'s health?',
    answer: 'Cleaner ducts mean less airborne dust, pollen, and microbial residue circulating through your home. Your HVAC works more efficiently, your filters last longer, and your air stays fresher — all of which support a healthier indoor environment.',
  },
  {
    id: 'q9',
    question: 'What is the Clean Air Certified badge, and who can use it?',
    answer: 'It\'s an official certificate from The Vent Guys showing that a property\'s air system has passed a NADCA-level mechanical hygiene process. Realtors, property managers, and homeowners can use it in listings or tenant documentation as proof of [verified indoor air quality](/clean-air-certified-property-listings).',
  },
  {
    id: 'q10',
    question: 'What makes The Vent Guys different from a standard HVAC company?',
    answer: 'We don\'t service or replace air conditioners — we protect the air itself. Our focus is [mechanical hygiene](/mechanical-hygiene-vs-duct-cleaning): inspecting, cleaning, and verifying the systems that control your indoor environment. It\'s a health-first approach backed by national standards and local expertise.',
