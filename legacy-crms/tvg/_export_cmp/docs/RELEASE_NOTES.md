# Release Notes - v2.5.0 (Horizon)

**Release Date:** December 16, 2025
**Version:** 2.5.0-STABLE
**Type:** Major Feature Freeze

## 🚀 Overview
Version 2.5.0 marks the completion of the "Horizon" development phase. This release solidifies the transition from a standard CRM to a multi-tenant, AI-enhanced Business Operating System (BOS). Key highlights include the stabilization of the Smart Call Console, the launch of the BHF Partner Portal, and the introduction of the System Doctor self-healing infrastructure.

## ✨ New Features

### 📞 Smart Call Console
*   **Call Hunter Interface:** Integrated Google Maps Street View and property data directly into the calling interface.
*   **Dynamic Scripting:** Scripts now auto-adjust based on the lead's persona (Homeowner vs. Property Manager).
*   **Rapid Disposition:** One-click outcomes (Left Voicemail, Booked, Bad Number) with automated follow-up triggers.

### 🏢 BHF Multi-Tenancy
*   **Tenant Isolation:** Strict RLS (Row Level Security) policies enforced across all core tables to ensure data separation.
*   **Onboarding Wizard:** Automated provisioning flow for new franchise tenants.
*   **Global vs. Local Config:** Feature flags can now be set globally or overridden per tenant.

### 🛠️ System Doctor & Diagnostics
*   **Self-Healing:** The system can now detect missing tables or columns and propose SQL fixes.
*   **Rollback Capability:** Critical actions now generate "Inverse SQL" allowing for safe undo operations within 24 hours.
*   **Dependency Auditing:** Automated scanning of `package.json` vs. actual usage.

### 🎓 Training Mode
*   **Sandbox Environment:** A dedicated toggle allows users to switch to a "Test Data Only" view without risking production records.
*   **Visual Indicators:** Persistent amber banners and UI elements indicate when Training Mode is active.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements
*   **Security:** Fixed `localStorage` dependency in Auth context; migrated to Supabase Metadata.
*   **Performance:** Optimized lead list rendering for large datasets (500+ records).
*   **Data Integrity:** Added foreign key constraints to `marketing_actions` to prevent orphan logs.
*   **UI/UX:** Standardized button components across the application (shadcn/ui adoption).

## 🔒 Known Limitations (v2.5.0)
*   **Offline Mode:** The application currently requires an active internet connection; offline caching is scheduled for v2.6.
*   **Mobile View:** The "Call Hunter" map view is optimized for Desktop; mobile users will see a simplified list view.
